Not just \"nice UI\" — I care about architecture, state management, performance and DX. <strong>Angular</strong> is my main weapon, but I also work with <strong>React</strong>, and I'm a genuinely fast learner: I pick up new tools, libraries and patterns quickly and put them into production safely.<br><br>Most developers either understand design or understand the business. I focus on both. While others argue about libraries, I'm shipping experiences that load fast, are accessible, rank well on SEO and actually move business metrics.<br><br>I've shipped SaaS products like <strong>Shelfie</strong> (AI-powered product image enhancer for small retailers) and I've built enterprise solutions for global brands through <strong>Globant</strong> in sectors like retail, travel and media. My GitHub and side projects are proof, not promises.<br><br>The result? Frontends that are maintainable for the team, enjoyable for the user, and valuable for the business.<br><br>When I'm not coding, I'm usually experimenting with new tools, gaming, or helping friends debug their own projects and setups.<br><br>I don't just build components. I build systems that let teams ship faster without losing quality."
